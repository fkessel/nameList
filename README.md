# BabyNames SQLite Database Project

Welcome to the BabyNames SQLite Database Project! This repository is dedicated to parsing publicly available birth name lists using Python and storing them in an SQLite database. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a comprehensive baby names database, making it easier for parents to decide on a name for their child. Additionally, there's a vision for a future application where partners can collaborate on prioritizing, favoriting, and excluding names.

## Features

- **Data Parsing:** Python scripts to parse open-access birth name lists from different cities, extracting names and gender assignments.

- **SQLite Database:** A SQLite database to store and manage the parsed baby names data.

- **Future Vision:** Planning for a collaborative application where partners can jointly prioritize, favorite, and exclude names, making the decision-making process enjoyable.
